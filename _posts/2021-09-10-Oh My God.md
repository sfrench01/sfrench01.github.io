title: "Oh My God GitHub"

This is not I repeat not my first attempt at making a GitHub website. And it probably won't be the last. I have been trying for years to make a blog from this website, what's funny however, is that once I started to get the hang of how GitHub works and even learn a bit of coding, I get distracted by other things in my life. Or it's one thing after the other that get in my way of writing blogs and figuring out how to post them on GitHub.


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
